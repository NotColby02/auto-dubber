1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Well, did they sing in the Philippines,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,360
did they sing the Christmas songs as well?

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Can I say something?

5
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,520
What?

6
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,240
Look at me right now.

7
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,040
Santa doesn't go there.

8
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,760
Santa doesn't go there.

9
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,400
No chance.

10
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,200
Yeah, he does.

11
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,760
Oh, really?

12
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,040
Imagine what Santa has to do.

13
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,680
Santa has to go to all the states, all the cities in America.

14
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,320
Yeah.

15
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,040
All of Europe.

16
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,240
You think he goes to America first?

17
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,440
No, definitely.

18
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:19,840
Yeah.

19
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,560
L.A. first.

20
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:20,880
Yeah.

21
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, L.A., New York.

22
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
L.A., New York, Chicago, Atlanta.

23
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,800
He's done.

24
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,680
He's in London.

25
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,280
It's five, three in the morning.

26
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,000
Sun's coming, right?

27
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,440
Elf calls him.

28
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,200
You forgot to go to the Philippines.

29
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,920
Oh, no.

30
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,400
Yeah.

31
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,280
What is he going to do?

32
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,920
Bail.

33
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,400
Bail?

34
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,280
Yeah, he's going to bail.

35
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,520
He's like, I'm not going to get across the Pacific

36
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,760
and go to that little island.

37
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,400
What the fuck?

38
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,920
And what does it give you guys?

39
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,960
Pineapples and coconuts.

40
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,720
You guys pick those.

41
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,280
Pick them.

42
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,000
Sing it right now.

43
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,480
I want to hear it.
