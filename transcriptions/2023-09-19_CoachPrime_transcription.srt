00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Let me tell you something, man.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,200
Travis got it. I rarely say that.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,840
Especially about somebody who plays my position.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,240
Mmm, Travis got it.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,280
He got it as an athlete.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,040
He has it as a person.

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,920
Travis is so far ahead of me.

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,040
When I was his age, it's ridiculous.

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,120
I wasn't that at his age.

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,560
I know this is going to go viral, and it should.

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,000
I was not that.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's a grown man right there, at that age.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,760
Sanders dropping back to pass, looking for Hunter,

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,680
and that's exactly what Travis Hunter can do right there.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,480
They say he's special. Y'all saw him right there.
